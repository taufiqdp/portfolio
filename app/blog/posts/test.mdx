# Diving Deeper into MDX

This post builds upon our initial exploration of MDX, showcasing more of what this powerful tool can do. We will be handling more complex tables, incorporating local and remote images, and demonstrating some useful markdown syntax for richer content.

## Images: Remote and Local

Let's start with images. Here's how you can embed images from remote URLs:

### Remote Image

You can also display local images if you have them placed within your project directory, usually in a public or static asset folder:

### Local Image

![Sample Logo](./og-profile-image.png)
_A sample project logo (make sure `sample-logo.png` exists in your public folder)._

**Note:** Make sure to have a file called `sample-logo.png` within your `/public` folder if using a framework like Next.js or in an assets directory that is accessible by your website. For example if your folder structure is like this:

### Table

Next, let's explore how to create more complex tables using markdown syntax:

| Name       | Age | Location |
| ---------- | --- | -------- |
| John Doe   | 25  | USA      |
| Jane Smith | 30  | Canada   |
| Alice Lee  | 22  | UK       |

This table is created using a simple markdown table syntax. You can add more rows and columns as needed.

## Custom Styling

This is just a glimpse of what you can achieve with MDX. Feel free to experiment with different features and create rich, interactive content for your projects.

That's it for this showcase. We hope you enjoyed exploring advanced MDX features. Stay tuned for more tutorials and guides on MDX and other web development topics. Happy coding! ðŸš€
